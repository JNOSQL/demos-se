== Introduction

Java SE sample using NoSQL with Jakarta NoSQL.

This project contains several projects with the primary goal of exploring the Jakarta NoSQL on several databases.

=== ArangoDB

image::http://www.jnosql.org/img/logos/ArangoDB.png[ArangoDB, width=200px]

**ArangoDB**: ArangoDB is a native multi-model database system developed by triAGENS GmbH. The database system supports three important data models (key/value, documents, graphs) with one database core and a unified query language AQL (ArangoDB Query Language). The query language is declarative and allows the combination of different data access patterns in a single query. ArangoDB is a NoSQL database system but AQL is similar in many ways to SQL.
